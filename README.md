# hello-world
today is 20201024 so I mark this special day!
In China, the programmer's day is October 24 which is also meaningful to me.


Totay, I create this hello-world repository to restart my coding career.
From now on, I will keep coding everyday and stick to learn something new everyday.
I always need to be growing, always need to be deepening their knowledge, always need to have a more thorough understanding of myselves and the world.
